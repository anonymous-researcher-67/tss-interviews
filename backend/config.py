# THRESHOLD: WORDS_OVERLAP_PERCENTAGE=0.3 means they share 30% of unique words.

# WORDS_OVERLAP_PERCENTAGE=1.0 means exact word match only.
WORDS_OVERLAP_PERCENTAGE = 1  # (Default: 0.3)
# Percentage (0.0 to 1.0) of transcript text assumed to be non-codable (headers, footers, metadata, 'Answer:').

# RESEARCHER STRATEGY TOGGLES
# ==============================================================================
# 1. TEXT ALIGNMENT
# If True, checks for overlapping text across DIFFERENT codes and unifies the text string.
# Example: Coder A marks "Hello World" as Code X. Coder B marks "Hello" as Code Y.
# Result: Both become "Hello World" so they can be compared as the same segment.
# If a Coder A codes a paragraph and Coder B codes just one sentence of it,
# this forces them to be treated as the same segment so their codes can be compared.
ALIGN_SEGMENTS_ACROSS_CODES = True  # (Default: False)

# 2. FILTERING (The "Ignore Silence" Rule)
# If True, filters the dataset to only include text segments that were identified (coded)
# by ALL coders (regardless of the specific code used).
# This effectively ignores "Unitization Errors" (Silence vs Code) and focuses purely on "Classification Agreement".
# Set to True to follow the instruction: "If one coder ignores a code, just ignore it."
# This calculates agreement ONLY on segments where BOTH coders marked something.
# It removes cases where one person coded a segment and the other missed it completely.
CALCULATE_SCORES_ON_MUTUAL_SEGMENTS_ONLY = False  # (Default: False)
# WARNING: If STRIJBOS_METHOD is set to 'METHOD_C' (Full List), you likely want
# 'CALCULATE_SCORES_ON_MUTUAL_SEGMENTS_ONLY' set to FALSE so that 1-0 disagreements are not filtered out.
# If set to True, it might override Strijbos settings by removing "Omissions".
# If STRIJBOS_METHOD is 'METHOD_A' or 'METHOD_B', this setting has no effect.

# 3. ANONYMIZATION
# If True, replaces actual researcher names with 'coder-1', 'coder-2', etc.
MASK_CODER_NAMES = True  # (Default: False)

# Choose which method to use for the "Agreements.txt" statistical report.
# METHOD_A : Mutual Agreement (Intersection). Excludes 0-0 and 1-0/0-1 mismatches.
# METHOD_B : Union Agreement. Includes 1-0/0-1 disagreements. Excludes 0-0 (Silence).
# METHOD_C : Full Master List. Includes 0-0 (Silence) as Agreement..

# AGREEMENT CALCULATION MODE
# ==============================================================================
# Determines how agreement is defined for statistics and the visual report.
# 1 = STANDARD (Exact Match):
#     Coders must select the exact same Code ID (e.g., "Emotions: Joy" vs "Emotions: Joy").
#     "Emotions: Joy" vs "Emotions: Happy" is a DISAGREEMENT.
#
# 2 = WEIGHTED (Category/Hierarchy Match):
#     Coders must select the same Category (e.g., "Emotions").
#     "Emotions: Joy" vs "Emotions: Happy" is a PARTIAL AGREEMENT (Counted as agreement for Kappa/F1).
#     Visuals will show a "Partial Agreement" icon for these items.
#
# Any other value will default to 1 (Standard).
AGREEMENT_CALCULATION_MODE = 1  # (Default: 1)
